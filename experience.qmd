# All Star PT Mira Mesa

- Internship as a Student physical therapist
- CI: Allen Maskell PT, DPT

In the summer of 2023, I was fortunate to work as a Student Physical Therapist at *All Star Physical Therapy* in Mira Mesa.
All Star PT is an in-network outpatient orthopedic physical therapy clinic.
Throughout my internship, I was able to learn how an in-network clinic is run and how to be both effective for my patients and a productive asset to the clinic.
I was able to treat a variety of post-operative conditions, notably complex foot surgeries and shoulder surgeries.
This is the first time I dealt with a patient experiencing post-op complication of hyperalgesia and through *pain neuroscience education* my CI and I were able to help this patient manage their pain and return to normal life.

I was able to be a part of a research study with Dr. Sara Gombatto as part of my final doctoral project in physical therapy school.


Currently, I work with Dr. Shahidi from UCSD on a research project involving Spinal Stenosis.

My doctoral project involved 



# Spinal Stenosis Research

In the summer of 2024, I began performing research with <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/bahar.shahidi">Dr. Bahar Shahidi</a>. 

Dr. Shahidi gave me much freedom with this study and allowed me to perform literature reviews, data cleaning, data analysis, and to create figures for this study.
During this study is where I became much more familiar with <i>R</i>, <i>Quarto</i>, and <i>Python</i> for data analysis and visualization.

All Star PT is an in-network outpatient orthopedic physical therapy clinic. Throughout my internship, I was able to learn how an in-network clinic is run and how to be both effective for my patients and a productive asset to the clinic. I was able to treat a variety of post-operative conditions, notably complex foot surgeries and shoulder surgeries. This is the first time I dealt with a patient experiencing post-op complication of hyperalgesia and through pain neuroscience education my CI and I were able to help this patient manage their pain and return to normal life.\n\n\nPT Tech - Seal Beach PT\n2021-2022"
